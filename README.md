# Hydration Tracker App
### Coding challenge for Genflow

Start frontend simply with
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

No third party library on the client side.

It took definitely more than 3 hours, probably the water filling effect and the overall styling was the most time consuming. And because of that I could not implement DynamoDB. Serverless and client communication has been tested with sls offline.
In the current state the GET request only receives hardcoded data. POST request sending the data but instead to save into a database, simply console logging.

The rest should be up to the requirements, the responsivity loosely tested, bugs might appear.

Let me know if there is any question.
